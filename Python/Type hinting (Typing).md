Type hinting allows the programmer to indicate the expected type of variables, function parameters, and return values. It provides a way to explicitly specify the types of variables and functions, which can enhance code readability, support static type checking, and allow better IDE support (e.g., for autocompletion, error detection, and refactoring).

Type hinting in Python does not change the runtime behavior of the code. Python remains dynamically typed, meaning type annotations are primarily for documentation, tooling, and static analysis purposes.

### **Why Use Type Hinting?**

1. **Readability**: Type hints make the code more understandable by clarifying the expected types of variables, function parameters, and return values. This improves the readability for others (or yourself) who are working with the code.
2. **Static Analysis**: Type hints allow tools like `mypy` and `flake8` to analyze your code before runtime, identifying potential type errors and inconsistencies. This helps catch bugs early in development.
3. **IDE Support**: Many modern IDEs (e.g., PyCharm, VSCode) and code editors provide enhanced autocompletion, type checking, and documentation features when type hints are present, improving the developer experience.
4. **Documentation**: Type annotations serve as a form of self-documenting code, making it easier to understand function signatures and variable purposes.

### **Basic Types in Python**

Python supports the use of basic types for type hinting. Here are some common examples:

#### 1. **Variables and Functions with Basic Types**

```python
x: int = 1          # An integer variable
y: float = 12.5     # A floating-point variable
z: bool = True      # A boolean variable
name: str = "Doe"   # A string variable

def hello(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

In this example:

- `x`, `y`, `z`, and `name` are annotated with basic types `int`, `float`, `bool`, and `str`, respectively.
- The function `hello` takes a `str` as an argument and returns a `str`.

#### 2. **Function Annotations**

- `def func(arg: int) -> str:` indicates that the function `func` takes an argument `arg` of type `int` and returns a value of type `str`.

```python
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b
```

In this case, the function `add` takes two integers and returns an integer.

### **More Advanced Type Hinting Concepts**

#### 1. **Union Type**

Sometimes, a variable or function can accept multiple types. To indicate this, you use `Union` from the `typing` module.

```python
from typing import Union

def process(value: Union[int, str]) -> str:
    return str(value)
```

Here, the `process` function can accept either an `int` or a `str` and will return a string.

#### 2. **Optional Type**

The `Optional` type is used to indicate that a value could either be of a specific type or `None`.

```python
from typing import Optional

def greet(name: Optional[str] = None) -> str:
    if name:
        return f"Hello, {name}!"
    return "Hello, stranger!"
```

In this example, `name` can either be a `str` or `None`. The default value for `name` is `None`.

#### 3. **List and Tuple Types**

You can annotate lists and tuples using the `List` and `Tuple` types from the `typing` module.

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_coordinates() -> List[float]:
    return [1.0, 2.5, 3.0]

def get_name_age() -> Tuple[str, int]:
    return ("Alice", 30)

# In tuple we need to sepecify all the types of the values
t : Tuple(int, int, int) = (1,2,3)
t1: Tuple(int) = (1,2,3) # -> This will throw an error

```

- `List[float]` indicates a list of floating-point numbers.
- `Tuple[str, int]` indicates a tuple where the first element is a `str` and the second is an `int`.

#### 4. **Dictionaries**

You can specify types for dictionaries using `Dict` from the `typing` module.

```python
from typing import Dict

def get_user_info() -> Dict[str, int]:
    return {"Alice": 30, "Bob": 25}
```

In this case, `Dict[str, int]` means a dictionary where keys are strings, and values are integers.

#### 5. **Callable Type**

The `Callable` type is used to specify a function signature, i.e., the types of its arguments and return value.

```python
from typing import Callable

def run_function(func: Callable[[int, int], int]) -> int:
    return func(5, 3)
```

In this example, `func` is expected to be a callable function that takes two `int` arguments and returns an `int`.

#### 6. **Type Alias**

A **type alias** can be used to give a name to a specific type.

```python
from typing import List

Vector = List[float]

def scale_vector(v: Vector, scalar: float) -> Vector:
    return [x * scalar for x in v]
```

Here, `Vector` is a type alias for `List[float]`, which improves readability in more complex types.

### **Static Analysis Tools**

Since Python does not enforce type annotations at runtime, static analysis tools are necessary to check whether the types used in your code are consistent with the type hints. The following tools are commonly used:

1. **`mypy`**:
    - `mypy` is the most popular static type checker for Python. It checks whether the types in your code match the type annotations.
    - To use `mypy`, install it with `pip install mypy`, then run `mypy` on your script:

```Bash
mypy your_script.py
```

    - Example of `mypy` output:

```other
your_script.py:5: error: Argument 1 to "process" has incompatible type "str"; expected "int"
```

1. **`flake8`**:
    - `flake8` is another tool that provides linting and static analysis, including checking type annotations.
    - It can be combined with plugins like `flake8-mypy` to run type checking alongside other linting checks.

    To use `flake8` with `mypy`, install:

```Bash
pip install flake8 flake8-mypy
```

1. **`pyright`**:
    - `pyright` is a fast type checker developed by Microsoft. It provides real-time type checking for Python code in VSCode.
