## What are Ai Agents?
An Agent is a system that leverages an AI model to interact with its environment in order to achieve a user-defined objective. It combines reasoning, planning, and the execution of actions (often via external tools) to fulfill tasks.
Think of the Agent as having two main parts:
1. **The Brain (AI Model)**
This is where all the thinking happens. The AI model **handles reasoning and planning**. It decides **which Actions to take based on the situation**.
2. **The Body (Capabilities and Tools)**
This part represents **everything the Agent is equipped to do**.
### What type of AI models we use for Agents?
The most common AI models that we use in the Agents are LLMs (Large Language Model)
