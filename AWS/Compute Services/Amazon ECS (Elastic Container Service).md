ECS (Elastic Container Service) is a fully-managed container orchestration service that Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides. It allows you to run and manage Docker containers on a cluster of virtual machines (EC2 instances) without having to manage the underlying infrastructure.

## ECS Launch Types
We can specify an amazon ECS launch type when running individual tasks or creating service.
