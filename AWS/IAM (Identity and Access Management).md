AWS IAM is an security service provided by the amazon web services that helps to control access to our AWS resources.

> [!note] IAM
> IAM lets you decide who (users, groups, or applications) can do what (specific actions like read/write/delete) and where (which AWS resources).

### Key Components of IAM

| Component                     | Description                                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Users**                     | Individual people or applications that need access to AWS resources. Each user has unique credentials (password, access keys). |
| **Groups**                    | A collection of IAM users. Permissions assigned to a group are inherited by all its members.                                   |
| **Roles**                     | Similar to a user but without credentials. Roles are assumed temporarily by users, applications, or AWS services.              |
| **Policies**                  | JSON documents that define permissions (what actions are allowed or denied on which resources).                                |
| **Identity Providers (IdPs)** | Allow external users (e.g., from Google, Microsoft AD, or SSO systems) to access AWS resources securely.                       |

### Uses of IAM

IAM is used for **managing access control and security** across AWS environments. Here are the main use cases:

##### 1. User Authentication and Authorization

- Create and manage user identities.
- Assign permissions for specific AWS services (like S3, EC2, Lambda, etc.).
- Example: Give a developer “read-only” access to S3 buckets but full access to EC2.

##### 2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- Use **roles** for EC2 instances, Lambda functions, or ECS tasks to securely access AWS resources **without storing access keys**.
- Example: An EC2 instance can assume a role that lets it read data from S3 but not delete it.

##### 3. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

- Enforce additional authentication (e.g., using an OTP or hardware token).
- Prevents unauthorized access even if passwords are stolen.

##### 4. Temporary Access (STS & Federated Access)

- IAM integrates with **AWS STS (Security Token Service)** to provide temporary credentials.
- External users (like contractors or applications) can be given time-limited access.

##### 5. Centralized Permissions Management

- Manage permissions for multiple AWS accounts via **AWS Organizations** and **IAM Identity Center (AWS SSO)**.

##### 6. Fine-Grained Access Control

- Apply precise permissions (e.g., allow `s3:GetObject` but deny `s3:DeleteObject` on a specific bucket).

### Why IAM is Important

IAM is **critical for AWS security** and proper governance. Here’s why:

#####  1. Security Foundation

- IAM is at the **core of AWS security**.
- It ensures only **authorized users** and **services** can access sensitive resources.

#####  2. Least Privilege Principle

- Assign the **minimum necessary permissions** to users or roles.
- Reduces risk of accidental or malicious actions.

#####  3. Auditing and Compliance

- AWS IAM integrates with **CloudTrail** to record all authentication and authorization activity.
- Essential for compliance (e.g., HIPAA, PCI-DSS, GDPR).

#####  4. Scalability and Manageability

- Easily manage access for hundreds or thousands of users across multiple services and accounts.
- Use groups, roles, and policies for consistency.
#####  5. Secure Automation
- Automate AWS operations (through SDKs or CLI) using **roles** instead of embedding access keys in code.
#####  6. Cross-Account and Federated Access

- Securely share resources between AWS accounts or external identity providers.

## IAM User
**IAM Users** (Identity and Access Management Users) are individual identities that you create in **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)** so that people or applications can access your AWS resources securely.
